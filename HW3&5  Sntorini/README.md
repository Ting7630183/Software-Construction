How to play the Game

Step1: click the bottom left button NEW GAME to initialize the game.

Step2: click the buttons on the top left to select two god cards. The first god card belongs to current player, and the second one belongs to next player.

Step3: click on four places on the board to place the god's players, the first and second place will belong to the first player, and the third and fourth place will belong to the second player.

Step4: to move the worker of a player, first click the player's place and then click on the place the player will move to. 

Step5: to build a block or dome, first click a cell in the board which contains the player, then click the filed the god will build a block or a dome, after that, click on the bottom on the bottom left to select a block or a dome. If you select the block, the player will build a block in the cell you have chosen, otherwise, the player will build a dome. The number in the field indicate the height of the tower. For example, if there is 1 in the field, it means that there is a block in the field, if 2 in the field, there are two blocks in the field.

Step6: iteratively go through step4 and step5, if a player stands on the cell with three floor, the game will over, and the very top left of the interface will show: ... has won!

The top right has a line shows current player, next player and valid/invalid and next action. If the move is valid, it will show Valid move!, if move is invalid, it will show Invalid move. Same for build, if the build is valid, it will show Valid build!, if not valid, it will show Invalid build! If there is any invalid move or build, the game will not stop and will not give the player second chance to move or build, instead it will proceed to next step. For example, if Pan's move is invalid, it will not move in this round but it can still build. Also, the line will show the next available actions.
