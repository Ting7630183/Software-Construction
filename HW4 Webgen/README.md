# Design Fixes

In each subsection, provide a short answer, typically not longer than a few bullet points or sentences, addressing all parts of the question indicated in square brackets. Where appropriate point to specific files/classes/methods and *use the design terminology* from the lecture (referring to specific design goals/principles/heuristics/patterns).

In many parts we ask for exactly two instances of a problem. The code often has more problems, so you may chose which ones you describe. In the implementation you should fix all problems, not just the two described here.

Also, your discussions may overlap in that you may have addressed several design problems with the same change. This is okay if a chance indeed relates to multiple design issues or questions.



## SubSubSubSubSubArticles

The way nested articles are represented in the implementation is problematic. Briefly describe why it is problematic and how you fixed it:



[why a problem]



[how fixed] 



## Responsibility Assignment

Describe two problems with responsibility assignment where fields or methods were in inappropriate places, why this was problematic, and how you fixed it:



[problem 1] [location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



[problem 2] [location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



## Code Duplication

Describe two instances of duplicate code that could be abstracted and reused using methods, inheritance, delegation, or design patterns and how you fixed it:



[problem 1] [location] [how fixed]



[problem 2] [location] [how fixed]



## Coupling

Describe two instances of unnecessary coupling, describe why this coupling is bad, and how you fixed it:



[problem 1] [location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



[problem 2] [location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



## Cohesion

Describe two instances objects, classes, or methods that severely violate cohesion (e.g., god class). Describe what concerns are mixed and how you fixed it:



[location] [concerns] [how fixed]



[location] [concerns] [how fixed]



## Extensibility

Describe two aspects of the implementation that are unnecessarily difficult to extend (i.e., require modifications of existing methods, possibly in multiple places) and how you improved it:



[location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



[location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



## Encapsulation

Describe at least to instances where a object/class violates encapsulation principles. Describe why it is problematic and how you fixed it:



[location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



[location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



## Instanceof

The use of `instanceof` is often an indication of a design problem. Provide two examples of methods that use `instanceof`, discuss why this use is problematic, and how you fixed it.



[location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



[location] [why a problem] [how fixed]



## Events (Challenge Problem)

If you want to claim bonus points for implementing events, briefly describe your design  and how you ensure that you can nest events in articles and vice versa:

[design description, one paragraph]



## Visitor Pattern (Challenge Problem)

If you want to claim bonus points for implementing the visitor pattern, name the file(s) where you implemented it:
